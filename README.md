The target is a derived ‘wealth index’ based on responses in various household surveys.
It is on a scale from 0 to 1, with 1 denoting higher wealth. 
This measure is based on multiple factors such as asset ownership, 
and gives a single measure across the different surveys and countries that we can use to compare data points in a consistent way.
Each row in the dataset corresponds to a cluster of survey responses, and so the Target is a measure of the average wealth for a given cluster of respondents.
